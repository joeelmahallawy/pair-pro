            It's very simple; click 'Start Pairing now' and you'll be added to a
            matchmaking queue. Once a developer with similar interests also
            joins the queue, you'll be matched and put in a chat room together.
            From there, you're able to host 1-on-1 zoom calls and speak about
            projects you're passionate about, and as they sayâ€“ the rest is
            history!
