          It's very simple; click 'Start Pairing now' and you'll be added to a
          matchmaking queue. Once a developer with similar interests also joins
          the queue, you'll be matched and put in a chat room together. From
          there, you're able to host 1-on-1 zoom calls and speak about projects
          you're passionate about, and as they sayâ€“ the rest is history!
